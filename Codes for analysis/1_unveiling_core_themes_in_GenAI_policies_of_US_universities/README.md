# About

- This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying core themes surrounding AI policies and guidelines across the top 50 U.S. universities.
-  Given the labor- and time-intensive nature required to manually synthesize multiple policy documents across many institutions, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify common and prevalent themes.
-  Our framework:  
    - first summarizes AI policies at the institutional level,
    - followed by the generation of multiple sets of themes through an iterative process of prompt chaining and self-refinement.
    - Finally, the common themes from these distinct sets were consolidated.

- This framework is designed to address potential flaws in pre-trained LLMs, such as hallucinations.
