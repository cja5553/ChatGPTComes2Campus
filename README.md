Codes for "ChatGPT Comes to Campus: Unveiling Core Themes in AI Policies Across U.S. Universities with Large Language Models", accepted in SIGCSE 2025. 

# About

- This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying core themes surrounding AI policies and guidelines across the top 50 U.S. universities.
-  Given the labor- and time-intensive nature required to manually synthesize multiple policy documents across many institutions, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify common and prevalent themes.
